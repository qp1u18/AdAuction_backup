## Overview
It is a	tool that will allow its	users	to	evaluate	the	
success	of	advertising	campaigns.	Specifically,	this	tool is able	to	read	data	gathered	
during	campaigns	and	then	display	key	metrics	about	the	campaign	on	a	user-friendly	and	clear	
dashboard. Besides, the dashboard also	allows	the	user	to	view	performance	metrics	over	time	and	
          within	particular	audience	segments or	contexts.	Such	fine-grained	information	about	
          performance	will	allow	the	user	to	detect	important	trends.

## Technical tools
- Java -- Programming language.
- IntelliJ IDE -- inbuilt Git GUI, works well with Maven.
- Maven -- Dependency manager for building and managing the Java project.
- JavaFX, Swing -- GUI.
- Scene Builder -- Layout JavaFX UI.
- Visual Paradigm, Draw.io -- Softwares for generating UML diagrams.
- Git -- Allow for all of us to work on the project at once. We plan on creating a new branch for
every new feature we add, and get someone to review the branch before it is merged into master.
We will use the universityâ€™s Gitlab rather than Github because it is more secure.
- SQLite -- Database system.
